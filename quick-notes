1. Different between Clicks and Pageviews (of Logos/Banners):
- Normally they are same same or event equal.
- Pageviews are more than clicks for a same item if: the link to the item was shared via FB/Zalo group, campaign emails and user view the item via the link, not click on the original pages of website or app.
  Another case is some pages of website not track the click event of the same item.
  
- Clicks are more than pageviews for a same item if: use click the item on the original website/app which are tracked, but they close sooner than the pageview is recorded or the network/system was bad so can record the pageview event.
